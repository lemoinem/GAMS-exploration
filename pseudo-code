parse dynamic-sets => extract list of dynamic sets
   comma and new-line separated space independent list

parse strategies => extract list of strategies for generating new initial points
 kind of strategies:
   stage:
     e: when dynamic set is empty
     1: when dynamic set receive its first element
     n: when dynamic set receive an additional element
   looping:
     i: independent new initial point
     c: new initial point derived from a previous solution point (not allowed for empty stage)
     f: new family of initial points derived from a previous solution point by using the strategie on each element of the set in the previous iteration (allowed only for additional stage)
   looping variables:
     %e: new element in the set (not allowed for independent looping)
     %c: current element in the iteration over the previous value of the set (allowed only for family looping)

parse stop => extract stop criterion

generating initial points for first iteration

main loop:
  for each initial point and each solver:
    run gams
    extract solution from the lst file
  next iteration:
    prepare addition of a new element in the first dynamic set
    generate new initial points
    check stop criterion
    if stop criterion reached and another dynamic set is available, empty dynamic set and goto 'next iteration' using next dynamic set
    if stop criterion reached and no more dynamic set is available, exit main loop
  goto main loop

print best solution
